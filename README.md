# Project includes:

1. Microinteractions

When clicking on tiles or cards a grey colored container around the object could be seen, indicating the whole tappable area.

2. Custom sliver appbar

When list is overscrolled over the top, the large title switches to the smaller one.
The list must be scrollable to get such result, meaning if the list does not fill the screen height on Android it will not show this kind of animation. iOS has different scroll behaviour, thus will result in always-working animation

3. Explicit and implicit animations

4. Filesystem

Shared preferences

5. State management

BloC

6. Architecture

Sort of clean architecture

7. Version

Flutter 3.10.5 
Dart 3.0.5
